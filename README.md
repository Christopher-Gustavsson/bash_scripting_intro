# Bash_Scripting_Intro

The `#! /bin/bash` is called a "shebang". It is the absolute path to the Bash interpreter and ensures that bash will be used to interpret the script, even if it is executed under another shell.

To get the directory of your bash interpreter run
```bash
  which bash
```
Run `chmod +x <filename>.sh` to make the file executable
